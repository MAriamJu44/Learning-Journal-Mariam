# My Learning Journal Website

This is my first web development project. I created a personal website using HTML and CSS as part of an assignment. It helps me document what I learned and practice writing real code by myself.

## What's in the website:

- A short introduction about me ðŸŒ¸
- A list of 3 skills I learned so far (HTML, CSS, GitHub)
- 2 learning journal articles where I share my progress ðŸ“–
- A contact section with my email and links

## Technologies used:

- HTML5 with semantic tags like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`
- CSS to style the layout, colors, and fonts
- I used flexbox, padding, margin, and box-shadow
- Also added hover effects and some transparency

## Why I made it:

I want to become better in web development, and building this website was a great way to practice.  
I wrote the code myself and tried to make the design look soft, clear, and inspiring.

## My favorite line:

_"Every line of code I write is a step toward my dream."_
